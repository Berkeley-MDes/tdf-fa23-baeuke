# Weekly report //5

## Summary
This week we started with setting up the Photon 2, developing three project ideas for a given field, and then choosing best 3 among all to work on for the next 3-4 weeks. 
<br/>

## Process
First, I wasn't able to prepare the photon 2 in advance for the class on Friday, and when prof. Sudhu started showing the tutorial in class, I thought I wouldn't be able to catch up with everyone else. And was sitting and looking at Jingyi's work, until she suggested me to use the hotspot to do the initial setup. So, I was able to do it in class:

<br/>
<br/>
Then, following the tutorial on git, made the LED blink:

<br/>
<br/>
On Tuesday we were brainstorming on project ideas, our scope was "Agriculture" and we actually did well and came up with many great ideas. However, I was a little bit upset to work on "Agriculture" related project (just because it's not a field I'm interested in and have no prior experience). But it ended up that we choose a project ourselves from the pool of all ideas (which is veery cool!), so I chose my top 3:

<img src="weekly-reports/week-5/5_2.png" alt="pic2_1" width="50%">
<br/>
Based on my interests and experience, I chose:<br/>
1) Enhancing Interpersonal Connections: Exploring Subtle Communication Tools for Friendships and Relationships<br/>
2) Mindful Meditations: An Interactive Flower Guide for Stress Relief and Color Therapy Tracking<br/>
3) Collaborative Song Crafting: Empowering Local Music Enthusiasts with Asynchronous Music Creation

# Weekly report //4

## Summary

I spent most of my days this week working on a project from my elective course since it's related to the field I want to explore now. But I'm also very intterested in the 2nd TDF project and is related to my background. So, hopefully will really challenge myself this time.

For now, nothing to say, and I've got my kit:)

# Weekly report //3

Finally made it! :D

## Reflections

This week was a bit easier (hopefully made some progress), I watched TJ's youtube tutorial for the simpler version of the cell phone stand and it made a lot of things indeed clearer. Untill now I didn't understand why do we always have an additional data structure to store some value, but it seems that it just makes it easier to navigate in the file and now "what stores what" kinf of things (since you also usually give some name for this data structure containing a point/plane/shape/etc.).. 
<br/><br/>
Also Fareha helped me a lot with my final laser cut, she had a same issue with the stand being loose and unstable, so she suggested me to decrease material thickness from 6mm to 5mm which makes the holes actually a bit smaller than the needed size, but a rubber hammer makes everything perfect at the end.

## Process
As said, first started with TJ's tutorial:

<img src="weekly-reports/3_2.png" alt="pic2_1" width="50%">
<br/>
<br/>
And was simultaneously analyzing the provided Rhino and grasshoper projects:

<img src="weekly-reports/3_3.png" alt="pic2_1" width="50%">
<br/>
<br/>
And, after understanding the basic navigation inside the software, I decided to make my own slightly customized stand. Actually my last cut fit my smartphone quite well, but it was a bit uncomfortable since it had parts of frame from above, making it a bit difficult to insert a phone, and as was said it was also a little bit loose and unstable:
<img src="weekly-reports/3_4.png" alt="pic2_1" width="50%">

<br/>
<br/>
I adjusted the provided project in the way I wanted the stand to be:
<img src="weekly-reports/3_5.png" alt="pic2_1" width="50%">
<br/>
<br/>
Made my 3rd cut:
<img src="weekly-reports/3g_2.gif" alt="pic2_1" width="50%">
<br/>
<br/>
and here is the result:

# Weekly report //2

## Reflections

For this week, I worked on the laser cut handle, last class it didn't really cut through, and I should have checked that before removing one piece (so that I could laser cut it again), but now at least I know how to do that properly. I'm still struggling with the Rhino and grashoper.. 

## Process
Last time, my laser-cut failed, it looked okay at the beginning:

<img src="weekly-reports/2_1.JPG" alt="pic2_1" width="50%">


but when I looked at the back side it was aparent that it didn't cut through:

<img src="weekly-reports/2_2.JPG" alt="pic2_1" width="50%">


So I used a box cutter to cut them manually by hand:

# Weekly report //1

## Reflections

Overall, I learnt that it‚Äôs VERY important to start working on the project and homeworks ASAP, and my first laser cut printing attempt shows this, but it‚Äôs still okay, glad that I learnt this early enough.
There were lots of things this first week, so needed some time to adjust..

## Process
First, I just opened the Rhino and was trying to figure out the way to change things:

![1st img](weekly-reports/1.png)  


Then I realized that I was looking at a wrong file haha, so asked Vidit and he suggested me to look at the CellPhoneStandModel_all file; so here I was on the right path:

![5th img](weekly-reports/5.png)  


I made some small changes, baked the file and exported the .ai file:

![6th img](weekly-reports/6.png)  


Then I passed the quiz for the laser cutting printers at the 2nd attempt (now I know that you cannot leave a laser cutter while it's printing:D):

![2nd img](weekly-reports/2.png)   



At Jacobs, had some issues with signing in to Creative Cloud:

![8th img](weekly-reports/8.JPG)  


For some reason the dimensions were shrinked when I opened the file on Illustrator at the lab machine, so this is what I got:

![9th img](weekly-reports/9.JPG)  



Also, because it was shrinked, the thinkness of the material wasn't suitable for the model:

# Hello DES INV 202 Student!
Welcome to your new GitHub repository! 

If you‚Äôre new to GitHub, you can think of this as a shared file space (like a Google Drive folder, or a like a USB drive that‚Äôs hosted online.) 

This is your space to store project files, videos, PDFs, notes, images, etc., and (hopefully, neatly) organize so it's easy for viewers (and you!) to navigate. That said, it‚Äôs super easy for you to share any file or folder with us (your TDF instructional team) - just send us the link! 

The specific file that I‚Äôm typing into right now is the **README.md** for this repo. 
##### (üí° TIP: The .md indicates that we‚Äôre using [Markdown formatting.](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)) #####
<h6> (üí° TIP 2: GitHub Markdown supports <a href="https://gist.github.com/seanh/13a93686bf4c2cb16e658b3cf96807f2"> <em>HTML formatting</em> too, including emojis üòÑ</a>, in case that helps!) </h6>

### :star: Whatever you write in your **README.md** will show up on the ‚Äúfront page‚Äù of your GitHub repo. This is where we‚Äôll be looking for your [weekly progress reports](https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/desinv-202/wiki/3.0-Weekly-Submissions). They might look something like this: ###

# Example Report 1 - Week of 08/21/2023 #
This week, I designed a cool phone stand made of rocks. Check out all my cool sketches and progress photos from this week below, etc., etc....

or, if you prefer, you can create separate files and link to them here, like so:

---
[Example Report 1](weekly-reports/example-report-1.md)

Either way, it's time to start making this space your own! If you want to save these instructions -- Don't worry, I already copied them over to another file for you [here.](welcomeREADME.md) So feel empowered to delete everything in this README.md and start documenting! 

sparkles,

your TDF TA, shm :sparkles:

PS: let me know if you have any questions!!
