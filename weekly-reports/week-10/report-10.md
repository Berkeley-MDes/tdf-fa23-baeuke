# Weekly report //10

## Summary
After our team project ended last week, and we began working on our own projects, I've been reflecting on how I did on project 2, to submit a report for Monday. Then spent some time experimenting with the ZeroWidth Workbench. This week has been pretty tough because I had a lot of assignments from my other classes.

## Terminology (just for my note)
RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) - is basically making an LLM connect to some database/sources from where it can retrieve and give the most relevant, up-to-date and accurate information. It also innvolves  using additional instructions for the LLM linked to the original prompt passed by a user. Without RAG, an LLM would give responses based on the info gathered before its training. RAG is convenient because now we don't have to retrain the whole model to give up-do-date info.
