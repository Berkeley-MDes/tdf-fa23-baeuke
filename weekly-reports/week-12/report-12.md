# Weekly report //12

## Summary
This week I was mainly researching and interviewing people around (about long distance relationship communications devices) to further refine my idea  for the final personal project and narrow down the scope. Specifically, I talked to our senior cohort 3 MDes students while working in the studio and actually came up with cool advice and even had a genius idea (:D) coming to my mind right in the middle of the conversation with one of the seniors. The new concept draws inspiration from Kazakh culture.

Also, we a had the Final Project Proposal submission where I kind of collected all my findings into one document.

## Process
<br/>
First, I talked to about 5-6 senior students about my idea and jotted down some takeaways and suggestions in my notes:

<br/>
We also came to a conclusion that every MDes cohort had a student working on a project with a similar idea XD.

Furthermore, I came up to this idea of using the shape of Kazakh Tumars (a neckless amulet) as a form factor for my device.

I noticed that I get quite serious whenever there is a cultural element involved in my projects, and I actually set up a call with a UK-based Kazakh artist who makes very beautiful traditional jewelry with ancient kazakh ornaments (traditional shapes). She helped a lot with researching the ornaments that I might use for our device, and we had a hall chat exchanging different findings:

And here are approxiamte ones I wanted to use (they are not the most beautiful ornaments, but they kind of resemble this heart <3 shape):

And, this is my submitted Project Proposal:

Finally, right before the last lecture for this week Rachel expressed interest in joining my project. So, now it's two of us working on the long distance communication device, which is very cool since she also has a background in CS and we can work together on software and hardware code as well as this project requires at least 2 microcontrollers.
