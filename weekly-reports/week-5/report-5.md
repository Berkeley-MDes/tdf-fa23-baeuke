# Weekly report //5

## Summary

I spent most of my days this week working on a project from my elective course since it's related to the field I want to explore now. But I'm also very intterested in the 2nd TDF project and is related to my background. So, hopefully will really challenge myself this time.

For now, nothing to say, and I've got my kit:)
