# Weekly report //11

## Summary
This week was mainly finalizing the project 3, writing its final report, and the ideation for the last personal project. So, there is really not much to write about for week 11. One thing I noted is that it's very important to document your work in the process of making, because if not done right, then you have to redo all the work you did just to capture screenshots of the moments in between your past progress. And, I spent quite some time on Monday deleting some instructions in ZeroWidth and creating them again for these screenshots.

Also I really loved the guest lecture by Mohit on Monday, and his cool projects. People like him truly inspire to make projects just for yourself - for fun!

As for the final personal project, I already have a vague idea of developing a communication device for people in long distance relationships (not necessarily romantic). Like a very simple wearable or a desktop device where you can send some signal by just tapping. However, I'm still in the ideation phase.
