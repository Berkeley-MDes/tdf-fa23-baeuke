# Weekly report //11

## Summary
This week was mainly finalizing the project 3, writing its final report, and the ideation for the last personal project. So, there is really not much to write about for week 11. One thing I noted is that it's very important to document your work in the process of making, because if not done right, then you have to redo all the work you did just to capture screenshots of the moments in between your past progress. And, I spent quite some time on Monday deleting some instructions in ZeroWidth and creating them again for these screenshots.
As for the 


## Process
<br/>
First, probably as most of the students from our cohort I just put some instructions saying like "you are Baurzhan, an MDes student...", and wanted to test on a demo:

<br/>
And based on the answer, I understood that I need some more context..
So, I literally wrote "you are not an AI programmed to mimic Baurzhan, you are actually him" kind of instruction:

<br/>
And this worked! 
Also, at this point I was already tired of asking it each time "who are you", so I decided to add a welcoming instruction so it was more like a chat bot experience.

<br/>
Additionally I just thought that this might be useful for future portfolio website integration.
<br/><br/>
The next step was adding the knowledge sets:

<br/>
From funny things, I decided to instruct my intelligence to write in style of a Kazakh poet Abai Kunanbayev and end sentences with a smily ':D' character:

<br/>
Now, since the main requirements were done, I wanted to connect to the API and build an app. First, I made simple app that only had a .html file just to see if I can make it quickly. However, I encountered an error:
<img src="10_6.png" alt="pic2_1" width="70%">
<br/>
I remember this error from project 2 when trying to send events from a web app to 2 photons, and the problem was that I was trying to make an API request directly from the client side, and the possible ways to solve this issue was to use some framework or tool and trying to connect from the server side.
<br/><br/>
So, using Shm's nodejs-starter-code once again, I built the app:
