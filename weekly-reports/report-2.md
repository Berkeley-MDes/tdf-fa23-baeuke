# Weekly report //2

## Reflections

Overall, I learnt that it’s VERY important to start working on the project and homeworks ASAP, and my first laser cut printing attempt shows this, but it’s still okay, glad that I learnt this early enough.
There were lots of things this first week, so needed some time to adjust..

## Process
Last time, my laser-cut failed
