# Weekly report //8

## Summary
So, this week mainly focused on making the web page work, and it eventually did (Shm and his node js starter code helped a lot:D). However, all UI I had was just one button on a blank page. So, after it worked I spent a little time on making the UI of our product look better (mainly was inspired by the existing Apple Watch meditation app's UI).

## Process
The final UI:
<br/>
<img src="8_1.png" alt="pic2_1" width="70%">
<br/>
Initially it doesn't have the "breath-in/out" texts, only a starting button. After "Turn ON!" button is pressed and the corresponding event is sent, it displays "breath-in" for 4 seconds, "hold" for a sec and "breath-out" for 4 seconds (just like our mechanical flower and bracelet are set).
