# Weekly report //6

## Summary
This week we started with setting up the Photon 2, developing three project ideas for a given field, and then choosing best 3 among all to work on for the next 3-4 weeks. 
<br/>

## Process
First, I wasn't able to prepare the photon 2 in advance for the class on Friday, and when prof. Sudhu started showing the tutorial in class, I thought I wouldn't be able to catch up with everyone else. And was sitting and looking at Jingyi's work, until she suggested me to use the hotspot to do the initial setup. So, I was able to do it in class:

<br/>
Then, following the tutorial on git, made the LED blink:

<br/>
On Tuesday we were brainstorming on project ideas, our scope was "Agriculture" and we actually did well and came up with many great ideas. However, I was a little bit upset to work on "Agriculture" related project (just because it's not a field I'm interested in and have no prior experience). But it ended up that we choose a project ourselves from the pool of all ideas (which is veery cool!), so I chose my top 3:

<br/>
Based on my interests and experience, I chose:<br/>
1) Enhancing Interpersonal Connections: Exploring Subtle Communication Tools for Friendships and Relationships<br/>
2) Mindful Meditations: An Interactive Flower Guide for Stress Relief and Color Therapy Tracking<br/>
3) Collaborative Song Crafting: Empowering Local Music Enthusiasts with Asynchronous Music Creation

## Speculations


    in complete sentences or paragraphs, and perhaps images or videos.
    speculation on future direction for the tools [so much is changing very quickly right now, where do you think this is going? Why do you think this?]
    speculation on future direction for the work
    bonus: thoughtful descriptions of something interesting and relevant you heard about in the news or industry publications. include text, an image, a link, and a reference that you can follow up on later and share with your peers.
